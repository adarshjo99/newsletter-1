**New AI tool generates high-quality images faster than state-of-the-art approaches**

Researchers developed a hybrid AI approach that can generate realistic images with the same or better quality than state-of-the-art diffusion models, but that runs about nine times faster and uses fewer computational resources. The tool uses an autoregressive model to quickly capture the big picture and then a small diffusion model to refine the details of the image.

**Novel memristors to overcome AI's 'catastrophic forgetting'**

Memristors consume extremely little power and behave similarly to brain cells. Researchers have now introduced novel memristive that offer significant advantages: they are more robust, function across a wider voltage range, and can operate in both analog and digital modes. Their unique properties could help address the problem of 'catastrophic forgetting,' where artificial neural networks abruptly forget previously learned information.

**Adaptive defenses against malicious jumping genes**

Adverse genetic mutations can cause harm and are due to various circumstances. 'Jumping genes' are one cause of mutations, but cells try and combat them with a specialized RNA called piRNA. Researchers have identified how the sites responsible for piRNA production evolve effective behaviors against jumping genes. This research could lead to downstream diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

**From dinosaurs to birds: the origins of feather formation**

Feathers, essential for thermoregulation, flight, and communication in birds, originate from simple appendages known as proto-feathers, which were present in certain dinosaurs.By studying embryonic development of the chicken, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) have uncovered a key role of a molecular signalling pathway (the Shh pathway) in their formation. This research provides new insights into the morphogenetic mechanisms that led to feather diversification throughout evolution.

**Why don't we remember being a baby? New study provides clues**

Though we learn so much during our first years of life, we can't, as adults, remember specific events from that time. Researchers have long believed we don't hold onto these experiences because the part of the brain responsible for saving memories -- the hippocampus -- is still developing well into adolescence and just can't encode memories in our earliest years. But new research finds evidence that's not the case. In a study, researchers showed infants new images and later tested whether they remembered them. When an infant's hippocampus was more active upon seeing an image the first time, they were more likely to appear to recognize that image later. The findings indicate that memories can indeed be encoded in our brains in our first years of life. And the researchers are now looking into what happens to those memories over time.

**Anti-amyloid drug shows signs of preventing Alzheimer's dementia**

An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's-related dementia in people destined to develop the disease in their 30s, 40s or 50s, according to the results of a new study. The findings suggest -- for the first time in a clinical trial -- that early treatment to remove amyloid plaques from the brain many years before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.

**New carbon-negative material could make concrete and cement more sustainable**

Researchers injected CO2 gas into seawater while applying an electrical current. The process transformed dissolved ions, minerals in seawater into clusters of solid particles. The clusters hold over half their weight in CO2 to become a carbon sink. Material could replace sand in concrete and be used in other construction materials while trapping CO2.

**Quantum heat dynamics toggled by magnetic fields**

The ability to conduct heat is one of the most fundamental properties of matter, crucial for engineering applications. Scientists know well how conventional materials, such as metals and insulators, conduct heat. However, things are not as straightforward under extreme conditions such as temperatures close to absolute zero combined with strong magnetic fields, where strange quantum effects begin to dominate. This is particularly true in the realm of quantum materials.

**New data on Mpox vaccine effectiveness**

A study has found that a single dose of the Imvanex vaccine provides protection against Mpox with 84% effectiveness. For people with HIV, however, a single dose of the vaccine fails to offer sufficient protection. All at-risk groups, and people with HIV in particular, should therefore receive the second dose of the vaccine as recommended.
